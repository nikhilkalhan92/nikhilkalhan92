Hi, my name is <strong>Nikhil Kalhan</strong>.</p>
  
I started my career in finance, but I always felt there was something more out there for me. 
Inspired by a fellow developer and driven by the desire to challenge myself, I took a leap into the world of coding.
       
That’s when I discovered <a href="https://www.codeinstitute.net/" target="_blank">Code Institute</a>. Just three days after learning about their Full Stack Diploma program, I signed up without hesitation. 

The course spanned one year, covering five projects—from the fundamentals of HTML to building a fully functional full-stack application. I was ready for the challenge, and after months of dedication and hard work,

I successfully completed the program and earned my diploma.
        
Now, I work as a developer at <strong>Bank of America</strong>, focusing primarily on backend development. However, I continue to expand my skill set by exploring various programming languages and technologies.

Hi, my name is Nikhil Kalhan

I am currently working in finance, but I realised that this wasnt for me and I needed a change

One quick google search and here I am on signing up to Code Institute....learning and coding about HTML/CSS/JS/PYTHON & more

I am so glad I made the change, I have one thing left to say lets do the work
